## Background

This module was extracted from the [explore.ipld.io](https://github.com/ipfs/explore.ipld.io) so it could be reused from the [IPFS Web UI](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui).

## Usage

**WARNING: This module is not intended to be re-used in it's current form by other projects.** It's just enough to work with a `create-react-app` set up, as long as you follow the steps below. There is much more work to do to make this a nice set of generic components.

Install it from npm:

```console
npm install ipld-explorer-components
```

The ES5 friendly version of the `src` dir is generated to the `dist` dir and the
page components are all provided as named exports so you can import them like so:

```js
import {ExplorePage, StartExploringPage} from `ipld-explorer-components`
```

The following Components are available:

```js
export {
  StartExploringPage,
  ExplorePage,
  IpldExploreForm,
  IpldCarExploreForm,
  CidInfo,
  IpldGraph
  ObjectInfo,
  exploreBundle
}
```

There are `peerDependencies` so that the parent app can pick the versions of common deps. You'll need to add relevant deps to your project.


And, assuming you are using `create-react-app` or a similar webpack set up, you'll need the following CSS imports:

```js
import 'tachyons'
import 'ipfs-css'
import 'react-virtualized/styles.css'
import 'ipld-explorer-components/dist/components/object-info/LinksTable.css'
import 'ipld-explorer-components/dist/components/loader/Loader.css'
```
