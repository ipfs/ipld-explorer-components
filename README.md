## Background

This module was extracted from the [explore.ipld.io](https://github.com/ipfs/explore.ipld.io) so it could be reused from the [IPFS Web UI](https://github.com/ipfs/ipfs-webui).

## Usage

**WARNING: This module is not intended to be re-used in it's current form by other projects.** There is more work to do to make this a nice set of generic components.

Install it from npm:

```console
npm install ipld-explorer-components
```

The ES5 friendly version of the `src` dir is generated to the `dist` dir and the
page components are all provided as named exports so you can import them like so:

```js
import {ExplorePage, StartExploringPage} from `ipld-explorer-components`
```

The following Components are available:

```js
export {
  StartExploringPage,
  ExplorePage,
  IpldExploreForm,
  IpldCarExploreForm,
  CidInfo,
  IpldGraph
  ObjectInfo,
  exploreBundle,
  heliaBundle
}
```

There are `peerDependencies` so that the parent app can pick the versions of common deps. You'll need to add relevant deps to your project.


And, assuming you are using `create-react-app` or a similar webpack set up, you'll need the following CSS imports:

```js
import 'tachyons'
import 'ipfs-css'
import 'react-virtualized/styles.css'
import 'ipld-explorer-components/dist/components/object-info/LinksTable.css'
import 'ipld-explorer-components/dist/components/loader/Loader.css'
```

### Adding another codec

**NOTE:** PRs adding an old IPLDFormat codec would need the old `blockcodec-to-ipld-format` tool which has many out of date deps. We will only accept PRs for adding BlockCodec interface codecs.

To add another codec you will need to:

1. Add a dependency on the codec to this package
1. Add the codec in the switch statement in src/lib/codec-importer.ts
1. Add a unit test to src/lib/resolve-ipld-path.test.js and ensure that calling `resolveIpldPath` returns the expected results
  * If the default `resolveFn` in src/lib/get-codec-for-cid.ts doesn't resolve your paths correctly, you will need to add a resolver method for your codec to the `codecResolverMap` in src/lib/get-codec-for-cid.ts

see https://github.com/ipfs/ipld-explorer-components/pull/360#discussion_r1206251817 for history.

### Redux-bundler requirements

These components use [redux-bundler](https://reduxbundler.com/) and your app will need to use a redux-bundler provider in order to propogate the properties and selectors. You can find a basic example of this in ./dev/devPage.jsx.

In short, these components export two bundles found in ./src/bundles: `explore` and `heliaBundle`. The explore bundle and components herein have a few redux-bundler selector dependencies that you need to make sure exist and are called properly.

| Dependent          | redux-bundler selector | Notes                                                                                                         |
|--------------------|------------------------|---------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------|
| explore bundle     | selectHeliaReady        | The explore bundle depends on this selector so it knows when the Helia node is available for use               |
| explore & other bundles     | selectHelia        | The explore bundle gets the Helia node via this selector |
| Main page (or any) | doInitHelia             | A consuming app needs to call this selector to tell the bundle that provides the Helia node to instantiate it. |

If you don't want to use the `heliaBundle`, i.e. like we won't in ipfs-webui, then you will need to make sure you adapt the selectors as appropriate.
